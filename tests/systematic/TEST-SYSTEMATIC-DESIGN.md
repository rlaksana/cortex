## 🔬 Methodology Details

### 1. Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

**Purpose**: Test at critical input boundaries to catch edge case defects

**Implementation**:
- String boundaries: min-1, min, min+1, max-1, max, max+1, empty, null
- Numeric boundaries: negative, zero, positive, boundaries
- UUID boundaries: valid, invalid formats, injection attempts
- Array boundaries: empty, single, maximum, overflow
- DateTime boundaries: valid past/future, invalid formats

**Coverage**: 146 boundary test cases

### 2. Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP)

**Purpose**: Partition input domains into valid and invalid classes

**Implementation**:
- Valid classes: All 16 knowledge types with proper data
- Invalid classes: Wrong types, missing fields, malformed data
- Search query classes: Valid queries, invalid inputs, injection attempts

**Coverage**: 44 equivalence class test cases

### 3. State Transition Testing

**Purpose**: Validate all valid and invalid state transitions

**Implementation**:
- Decision ADR lifecycle: proposed → accepted → deprecated → superseded
- Incident lifecycle: open → investigating → resolved → closed
- Todo lifecycle: open → in_progress → done → archived
- User session lifecycle: unauthenticated → authenticated → authorized

**Coverage**: 25 state transition test cases

### 4. Data Flow Testing

**Purpose**: Verify data integrity through system components

**Implementation**:
- Input validation flow: Zod → scope → data → storage
- Storage operation flow: validation → deduplication → database → response
- Search operation flow: query validation → search → ranking → response

**Coverage**: 12 data flow test cases

### 5. Control Flow Testing

**Purpose**: Test all decision branches and exception paths

**Implementation**:
- Conditional logic: authentication, scope validation, search modes
- Exception handling: validation errors, database errors, authentication errors
- Loop boundaries: batch processing, pagination, array iteration

**Coverage**: 32 control flow test cases

### 6. Risk-Based Testing

**Purpose**: Prioritize testing based on risk assessment

**Implementation**:
- Security risks: SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass
- Data integrity risks: validation corruption, transaction integrity
- Performance risks: large datasets, memory usage, concurrent load

**Coverage**: 24 risk-based test cases
