# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: PostgreSQL References

**This file documents the PostgreSQL removal for historical context.**

## PostgreSQL Migration Status: ❌ REMOVED

PostgreSQL has been **completely removed** from Cortex Memory MCP Server. The system now runs exclusively on Qdrant vector database.

### What Was Removed:
- PostgreSQL database dependencies
- All SQL schema and migration files
- Prisma ORM integration
- Dual-database architecture complexity
- PostgreSQL configuration and setup

### Current Architecture:
- **Single Database**: Qdrant vector database only
- **Simplified Setup**: No SQL database required
- **Vector-First**: Optimized for semantic search
- **Automatic Schema**: No manual migrations needed

### Files Archived:
All PostgreSQL-related files have been archived to prevent confusion. They are no longer needed and should not be referenced.

### For New Users:
**IGNORE any PostgreSQL references** you may find in old documentation or code comments. The system now uses **Qdrant only**.

See the main README.md for current setup instructions.
