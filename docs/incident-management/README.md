- **Key Features**:
  - Executive summary and detailed technical templates
  - Lightweight and quick retrospective formats
  - Meeting structure and documentation procedures
  - Action item management and quality assurance

### 4. [Severity Classification System](./severity-classification.md)
- **Purpose**: Define consistent incident severity classification (SEV-1 to SEV-4)
- **Key Features**:
  - Detailed severity definitions and impact criteria
  - Response time objectives and escalation triggers
  - Classification decision trees and procedures
  - Impact assessment frameworks and examples

### 5. [Response Coordination Procedures](./response-coordination.md)
- **Purpose**: Establish incident command structure and coordination protocols
- **Key Features**:
  - Incident command roles and responsibilities
  - Cross-functional team coordination procedures
  - War room setup and management (physical and virtual)
  - External communication procedures and media protocols

### 6. [Learning and Improvement Methodologies](./learning-and-improvement.md)
- **Purpose**: Create frameworks for learning from incidents and driving improvements
- **Key Features**:
  - Root cause analysis methodologies (5 Whys, Fishbone, Timeline)
  - Knowledge management systems and learning communities
  - Action item management and implementation frameworks
  - Measurement systems and continuous feedback loops
