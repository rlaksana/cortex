- Decorator-based automatic validation (@secureInput)
- Configurable severity levels (low/medium/high/critical)

HTTP Configuration Features:
- Environment-specific configurations (dev/test/prod)
- Configurable timeouts for different operation types
- Exponential backoff retry with jitter protection
- Intelligent retryable status code and error detection
- Centralized header management with inheritance

Test Coverage:
- Performance monitor tests: 20/20 passing (100% success rate)
- Security runtime checks tests: 25/25 passing (100% success rate)
- HTTP configuration tests: 30/30 passing (100% success rate)
- Comprehensive test coverage for all major functionality
- Edge case testing and error condition validation
- Event emission testing for all major components

Configuration Details:

Performance Monitor Configuration:
- Metrics history limit: 1000 per operation
- Baseline storage: artifacts/performance-baseline.json
- Regression threshold: 50% slower than baseline
- Alert thresholds: 85th/95th percentile + absolute limits
- Automatic memory management with history culling

Security Configuration:
- Max input length: 10,000 characters (configurable)
- Blocked patterns: SQL, XSS, path traversal, command injection
- Allowed patterns: Optional whitelist support
- Custom validators: Domain-specific rule support
- Violation history: 1000 most recent violations

HTTP Configuration:
- Default timeout: 30s (environment-specific)
- Retry attempts: 3 (production) / 5 (development) / 1 (test)
- Backoff multiplier: 2x with 30s max delay
- Retryable codes: 408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504
- Max request/response sizes: Configurable per environment

Integration Points:
- Performance monitoring integrates with existing DI container
- Security checks integrate with HTTP client and API endpoints
- HTTP configuration integrates with existing HTTP client
- All services emit events for centralized monitoring
- Configuration files stored in artifacts/ directory
