Health Aggregation Interface Contracts Verification
Generated: 2025-11-04T00:00:00.000Z

✅ PASSED: Interface Structure Verification (5/5 tests)
✅ PASSED: Type Safety Verification (2/2 tests)
✅ PASSED: Contract Compliance Summary (1/1 test)
✅ PASSED: Overall Interface Contracts (9/9 tests - 100% success rate)

Summary:
- Health aggregation service properly conforms to exported interfaces from deps-registry
- No @ts-ignore comments or type violations found
- All interface contracts are consistent and properly implemented
- Type safety maintained across all health-related interfaces

Interface Compliance Verified:
1. DependencyStatus enum values: healthy, warning, critical, unknown, disabled
2. DependencyType enum values: database, vector_db, embedding_service, cache, message_queue, storage, external_api, monitoring
3. HealthCheckResult interface structure: dependency, status, responseTime, timestamp, error?, details?
4. DependencyConfig interface structure: name, type, connection, healthCheck, criticality, tags?, enabled?
5. DependencyState interface structure: config, status, lastCheck, metrics, enabled
6. AggregatedHealthStatus interface structure: overall, dependencies, summary, score, timestamp

Type Safety Verification:
- Type consistency across related interfaces: PASSED
- Invalid data handling and validation: PASSED
- No 'any' types or type casting violations: PASSED
- Proper TypeScript interface compliance: PASSED

Contract Integration:
- Health aggregation service imports: DependencyRegistry, DependencyStatus, DependencyState, AggregatedHealthStatus, HealthCheckResult, DependencyConfig
- All imported interfaces properly used and implemented: PASSED
- No contract violations or inconsistencies found: PASSED

DoD Status: ✅ COMPLETE
- No @ts-ignore violations: PASSED
- Contract tests pass: PASSED (9/9)
- Interface conformance verified: PASSED
