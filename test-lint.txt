Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 9.38.0

A configuration object specifies rule "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars", but could not find plugin "@typescript-eslint".

Common causes of this problem include:

1. The "@typescript-eslint" plugin is not defined in your configuration file.
2. The "@typescript-eslint" plugin is not defined within the same configuration object in which the "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars" rule is applied.
