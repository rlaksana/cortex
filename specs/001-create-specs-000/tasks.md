# Tasks: Cortex Memory MCP v1

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-create-specs-000/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This feature explicitly requests TDD approach - all phases include RED‚ÜíGREEN‚Üírefactor cycles.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Single MCP server project: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Migrations: `migrations/` directory
- Contracts: Pre-generated in `specs/001-create-specs-000/contracts/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure) - Slice 0

**Purpose**: Project initialization, build tools, CI pipeline

- [x] T001 Create project structure: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/`, `tests/`, `migrations/`, `.env.example`
- [x] T002 Initialize TypeScript project with dependencies: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.0+`, `zod@3.22+`, `pg@8.11+`, `pino@8.16+`, `drizzle-kit@0.20+`, `vitest@1.0+`, `@testcontainers/postgresql@10+`, `k6@0.48+`
- [x] T003 [P] Configure ESLint + Prettier in `eslint.config.js`, `.prettierrc.js`
- [x] T004 [P] Setup Vitest config in `vitest.config.ts` (unit + integration test modes)
- [x] T005 [P] Create CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint, typecheck, test, build)
- [x] T006 Create npm scripts in `package.json`: `dev`, `build`, `test`, `test:integration`, `test:e2e`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `db:generate`, `db:migrate`, `db:seed`
- [x] T007 [P] Create base logger in `src/utils/logger.ts` using Pino with structured JSON output
- [x] T008 [P] Create environment config loader in `src/config/env.ts` using `zod` to validate `DATABASE_URL`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `NODE_ENV`

**Exit Criteria**: `npm run test` executes empty test suite successfully; CI pipeline passes on empty repo

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 (requires memory.find to exist) - Can partially overlap with US1 Part C
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 1 (requires memory.store services) - Can work in parallel with US2
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 1 + 2 (requires memory.find with scope filtering) - Can work in parallel with US3
- **E2E Integration (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete
- **Performance & Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on E2E Integration completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: FOUNDATIONAL - all other stories depend on this
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Extends User Story 1 (adds scope filtering to memory.find)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Extends User Story 1 (adds immutability to memory.store services)
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Extends User Story 1 + 2 (adds intelligent routing to memory.find)

### Within Each User Story (TDD Order)

1. **RED**: Write tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimum code to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up, extract helpers, optimize
4. Models/schemas before services
5. Services before MCP tool wrappers
6. Core implementation before extensions

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T003 (ESLint), T004 (Vitest), T005 (CI), T007 (logger), T008 (env config) can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T009, T010, T011 (tests) can run in parallel; T019 (scope inference), T020 (hash utility) can run in parallel
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: Within each part (A, B, C), all tests marked [P] can run in parallel; within Part C, T042-T049 (knowledge services) can run in parallel
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: T055, T056, T057 (tests) can run in parallel
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: T064, T065, T066, T067 (tests) can run in parallel
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: T075, T076, T077, T078 (tests) can run in parallel
- **Phase 7 (E2E)**: T087, T088, T089, T090 (tests) can run in parallel
- **Phase 8 (Perf)**: T098, T099, T100 (tests) can run in parallel; T101, T102, T103 (perf scripts) can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Part A

```bash
# Launch all tests for memory.store together (RED phase):
Task: "Contract test for memory.store in tests/contract/memory-store.test.ts"
Task: "Idempotency test in tests/integration/memory-store-idempotency.test.ts"
Task: "Content deduplication test in tests/integration/memory-store-dedupe.test.ts"
Task: "Audit trail test in tests/integration/memory-store-audit.test.ts"

# Implement service layer (GREEN phase):
Task: "Copy Zod schemas to src/schemas/knowledge-types.ts"
Task: "Implement memory.store service in src/services/memory-store.ts"
Task: "Create audit logging helper in src/db/audit.ts"
Task: "Integrate audit logging into memory-store.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only - Slice 2, 3, 4)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (Slice 0)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (Slice 1) - CRITICAL BLOCKING PHASE
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 Part A (memory.store for sections)
4. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 Part B (memory.find for sections)
5. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 Part C (all 9 knowledge types)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently - can store and retrieve all 9 types
7. Deploy/demo if ready - this is a functional MVP

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. **Foundation**: Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Database ready, test infrastructure operational
2. **MVP (US1)**: Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **DELIVERABLE: Core store/find functionality**
3. **Branch Isolation (US2)**: Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **DELIVERABLE: Multi-branch support**
4. **Governance (US3)**: Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **DELIVERABLE: Production-ready audit/immutability**
5. **Intelligence (US4)**: Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **DELIVERABLE: Enhanced search UX**
6. **Integration (E2E)**: Complete E2E phase ‚Üí **DELIVERABLE: Full MCP server over STDIO**
7. **Performance (Perf)**: Validate SLOs ‚Üí **DELIVERABLE: v1.0.0 release candidate**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Week 1**: Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T023)
2. **Week 2-3**: Once Foundational is done, split into parallel tracks:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 Part A + B (memory.store + memory.find for sections)
   - Developer B: User Story 1 Part C (extend to 9 knowledge types)
   - Developer C: Foundational test coverage + documentation
3. **Week 4**: Integrate User Story 1, validate MVP
4. **Week 5**: Parallel again:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (branch isolation)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (audit/immutability)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (routing/suggestions)
5. **Week 6**: E2E integration + performance validation
6. Stories complete and integrate independently, MVP can ship at any checkpoint

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies between them - safe to parallelize
- **[Story] label** maps each task to specific user story (US1, US2, US3, US4) for traceability
- **TDD Workflow**: RED (write failing test) ‚Üí GREEN (implement to pass) ‚Üí REFACTOR (clean up)
- **Each user story** should be independently completable and testable - can ship US1 without US2/US3/US4
- **Verify tests fail** before implementing (RED phase validation)
- **Commit after each task** or logical group (e.g., after completing all US1 Part A tests)
- **Stop at any checkpoint** to validate story independently - deliver incrementally
- **Avoid**: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- **Constitutional alignment**: All tasks mapped to constitution principles - validate after Phase 8 completion

---

## Total Task Count

- **Setup**: 8 tasks (T001-T008)
- **Foundational**: 15 tasks (T009-T023)
- **User Story 1**: 31 tasks (T024-T054)
- **User Story 2**: 8 tasks (T055-T063)
- **User Story 3**: 11 tasks (T064-T074)
- **User Story 4**: 12 tasks (T075-T086)
- **E2E Integration**: 7 tasks (T087-T097)
- **Performance & Polish**: 12 tasks (T098-T109)
- **TOTAL**: **109 tasks**

**Parallel opportunities**: 45 tasks marked [P] (41% can run in parallel)

**Suggested MVP scope**: Phases 1, 2, 3 (User Story 1 only) = **54 tasks** ‚Üí delivers core store/find for all 9 knowledge types
