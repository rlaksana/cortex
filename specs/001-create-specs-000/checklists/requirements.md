# Specification Quality Checklist: Cortex Memory MCP v1

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: Postgres 18+ is a constitutional requirement, not an implementation detail. All other requirements describe WHAT not HOW. Success criteria are user-facing outcomes.

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: All 4 user stories clearly articulate value: cross-session memory (P1), branch isolation (P2), audit/compliance (P3), search UX (P3). Business justification explicit.

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: User stories use plain language describing AI agent workflows. Technical terms (ADR, TTL, etc.) are explained in context. Functional requirements provide technical precision without assuming implementation knowledge.

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: User Scenarios & Testing ✓, Requirements ✓, Success Criteria ✓, Key Entities ✓, Edge Cases ✓, Assumptions ✓, Dependencies ✓, Out of Scope ✓

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: Zero clarification markers. User provided comprehensive requirements with SOT gist as authoritative reference. All ambiguities resolved via informed assumptions (documented in A-001 through A-012).

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: All 55 functional requirements use MUST/MAY language with specific acceptance criteria. Each FR maps to verifiable behavior (e.g., FR-049: P95 < 300ms on ≤3M sections).

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: All 10 success criteria include quantitative metrics: latency thresholds (SC-001, SC-007), relevance percentage (SC-002), audit coverage (SC-004), boolean outcomes (SC-003, SC-006, SC-010).

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: All SCs describe user-facing outcomes without implementation details. No mention of databases, frameworks, or code structure. Focus on what users observe/experience.

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: 4 user stories with 13 total acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format. Each scenario is independently testable and maps to functional requirements.

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: 8 edge cases documented covering error conditions (empty query, malformed scope, missing extensions), race conditions (concurrent mods, TTL expiration), and failure modes (audit log failure, scope inference failure).

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: Out of Scope section (OS-001 through OS-010) explicitly excludes v2+ features: Qdrant/Neo4j integration, ML reranking, horizontal scaling, UI, binary content. v1 focus: 2-tool API, Postgres SoT, branch isolation.

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: 6 dependencies documented (D-001 through D-006): Postgres 18+, MCP SDK, validation libs, git context, SOT gist, constitution. 12 assumptions (A-001 through A-012) document all informed guesses.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: 55 functional requirements grouped into 9 categories. Each FR is verifiable: API contracts (FR-001 to FR-006), knowledge types (FR-007 to FR-016), scope/isolation (FR-017 to FR-021), search/ranking (FR-022 to FR-030), storage/dedupe (FR-031 to FR-035), immutability/audit (FR-036 to FR-040), TTL (FR-041 to FR-044), database/performance (FR-045 to FR-051), error handling (FR-052 to FR-055).

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: 4 prioritized user stories cover complete feature surface: P1 (store/retrieve core), P2 (branch isolation), P3 (audit/immutability), P3 (search routing). Each story is independently valuable and testable.

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: All 10 success criteria are achievable with specified requirements. Performance targets (SC-001, SC-007) align with constitution SLOs. Relevance target (SC-002) has defined evaluation method (A-010).

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Notes**: Constitutional requirements (Postgres 18+, pg_trgm, uuidv7) are captured in Dependencies (D-001), not in Success Criteria. SCs describe user-observable outcomes only.

## Validation Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASS

**Total Items**: 14 validated
**Passed**: 14
**Failed**: 0

**Readiness Assessment**: Specification is READY for `/speckit.plan` command.

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation design artifacts
2. OR run `/speckit.clarify` if additional refinement needed (optional, all requirements complete)

## Notes

- **Zero clarifications needed**: User provided authoritative SOT gist with complete JSON schemas, database DDL, and performance targets. All edge cases and ambiguities resolved via reasonable defaults (documented in Assumptions).

- **Constitutional alignment**: All 7 constitutional principles represented: Minimal API (FR-001), Single SoT (FR-045), Branch Isolation (FR-018), Immutability (FR-036, FR-037), Extensibility (FR-022 mode routing), Performance SLOs (FR-049, FR-050, FR-051), Type Safety (FR-007 through FR-016).

- **Comprehensive coverage**: 55 functional requirements, 4 user stories with 13 scenarios, 10 success criteria, 9 key entities, 8 edge cases, 12 assumptions, 6 dependencies, 10 out-of-scope items.

- **Test-ready**: All acceptance scenarios written in Given-When-Then format, directly translatable to TDD test cases per constitutional requirement.
