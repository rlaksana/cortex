# Session Completion Checklist - Cortex MCP Development

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Phase 5: Business Rule Error Handling (P5-T5.3)
- ✅ Fixed decision immutability validator test (main failing test)
- ✅ Fixed remaining batch processing test (11/12 tests passing)
- ✅ Re-ran P5-T5.3 business rule error handling tests
- ✅ Completed quality gates - type-check ✅, lint ✅
- ✅ Stored P5-T5.3 completion in Cortex Memory system

### Phase 6: Expiry Implementation (P6)
- ✅ **P6-T6.1**: Expiry time calculation with TTL mapping (default=30d, short=24h, long=90d, permanent=∞)
- ✅ **P6-T6.2**: Created scheduled/cron worker for expired item deletion
- ✅ **P6-T6.3**: Applied default org scope when memory_find called without scope
- ✅ All P6 quality gates passed - type-check ✅, lint ✅

### Phase 7: Documentation & Architecture (P7)
- ✅ **P7-T7.2**: Moved 'service layer not fully wired' note to top 25% README with enhanced analysis
- ✅ Enhanced README with comprehensive service layer documentation
- ✅ Quality gates passed - lint ✅

### API Documentation (Current Session)
- ✅ Created `docs/cortex-mcp-api-short.md` (≤120 lines)
- ✅ Included new store/find response shapes, supported kinds, current limits
- ✅ Quality gates passed - type-check ✅, lint ✅

## 🔄 Remaining Tasks (Target: Complete All)

### Phase 8: Production Features (P8)
- 🔄 **T8.1**: Add audit event logging for every memory_store operation (IN PROGRESS)
- ⏳ **T8.2**: Add per-actor/per-tool rate limit
- ⏳ **P8-T8.3**: Expose metrics (store_count, find_count, dedupe_rate, validator_fail_rate, purge_count)

### Final Steps
- ⏳ Run quality gates for each T8 implementation
- ⏳ Perform proper git management before committing changes
- ⏳ Store final session completion to mcp__cortex memory
