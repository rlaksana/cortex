## Risk Assessment: Authentication Service Security Vulnerabilities

### Risk 1: Password Hashing Algorithm Weakness
**Risk ID:** RISK-SEC-001  
**Category:** Security Vulnerability  
**Probability:** Medium (30% chance of exploitation within 6 months)  
**Impact:** High (credential compromise, data breach)  
**Risk Score:** 15/25 (High Priority)

**Risk Description:**
Current password hashing uses bcrypt with cost factor 10, which may not meet modern security standards. Cryptographic advances and hardware improvements increase feasibility of brute force attacks.

**Affected Components:**
- User password storage in PostgreSQL
- Authentication verification logic
- Password reset functionality

**Potential Impact:**
- User credentials could be compromised if database is breached
- Brute force attacks become more feasible with modern hardware
- Regulatory compliance issues (GDPR, SOC2)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Immediate (High Priority):**
   - Increase bcrypt cost factor to 12
   - Implement adaptive hashing based on hardware performance
   - Add password complexity requirements

2. **Short-term (30 days):**
   - Evaluate Argon2 algorithm implementation
   - Implement password hashing migration strategy
   - Add rate limiting for password attempts

3. **Long-term (90 days):**
   - Full migration to Argon2id algorithm
   - Implement hardware security module (HSM) support
   - Add password breach detection integration

### Risk 2: Single Point of Failure - Database
**Risk ID:** RISK-INFRA-002  
**Category:** Infrastructure Reliability  
**Probability:** High (70% chance of failure in next 12 months)  
**Impact:** High (complete service outage)  
**Risk Score:** 21/25 (Critical Priority)

**Risk Description:**
Authentication service relies on single PostgreSQL database instance without proper failover or replication mechanisms. Database failure would cause complete authentication service outage.

**Affected Components:**
- User credential storage
- Session management
- Authentication state persistence

**Potential Impact:**
- Complete authentication service outage
- User inability to access all company applications
- Business operation disruption
- Revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Immediate (Critical Priority):**
   - Implement PostgreSQL streaming replication
   - Set up automatic failover mechanism
   - Create database backup retention policy

2. **Short-term (14 days):**
   - Deploy read replicas for load distribution
   - Implement connection pooling with failover logic
   - Add database health monitoring and alerting

3. **Long-term (60 days):**
   - Implement multi-AZ database deployment
   - Add database clustering for high availability
   - Evaluate managed database service options

### Risk 3: Session Token Security
**Risk ID:** RISK-SEC-003  
**Category:** Security Vulnerability  
**Probability:** Medium (25% chance of exploitation)  
**Impact:** Medium (unauthorized access to user sessions)  
**Risk Score:** 10/25 (Medium Priority)

**Risk Description:**
JWT tokens have 24-hour expiration without proper token revocation mechanisms. Compromised tokens remain valid until expiration, creating window for unauthorized access.

**Affected Components:**
- JWT token generation and validation
- Session management
- Logout functionality

**Potential Impact:**
- Unauthorized access to user accounts
- Session hijacking attacks
- Privacy violations
- Compliance issues

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Immediate (Medium Priority):**
   - Reduce token expiration to 4 hours
   - Implement token blacklist for logout
   - Add device fingerprinting to tokens

2. **Short-term (21 days):**
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
   - Add token revocation API endpoints
   - Implement suspicious activity detection

3. **Long-term (45 days):**
   - Implement short-lived tokens with refresh mechanism
   - Add token rotation functionality
   - Implement real-time threat detection

### Risk 4: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
**Risk ID:** RISK-OPS-004  
**Category:** Operational Risk  
**Probability:** High (60% chance of security incident going undetected)  
**Impact:** Medium (delayed incident response)  
**Risk Score:** 12/25 (Medium Priority)

**Risk Description:**
Current logging and monitoring lacks comprehensive security event coverage, making detection of sophisticated attacks difficult.

**Affected Components:**
- Security event logging
- Anomaly detection
- Incident response capabilities

**Potential Impact:**
- Security incidents go undetected
- Delayed incident response
- Inadequate forensic evidence
- Regulatory compliance issues

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Immediate (Medium Priority):**
   - Implement comprehensive security logging
   - Add real-time security monitoring
   - Create security alerting rules

2. **Short-term (30 days):**
   - Implement SIEM integration
   - Add user behavior analytics
   - Create automated incident response playbooks

3. **Long-term (90 days):**
   - Implement machine learning-based anomaly detection
   - Add threat intelligence integration
   - Create security operations center (SOC) procedures
