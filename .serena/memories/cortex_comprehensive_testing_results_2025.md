# Cortex Memory MCP Server Comprehensive Testing Results

## Test Environment
- Date: 2025-10-25
- Platform: Windows 11
- Node.js Environment: Working
- Server Entry Point: src/index-claude.ts

## MCP Server Operations Test Results

### ✅ Server Startup and Initialization
- Status: PASSED
- Details: Server starts successfully and runs on stdio
- OpenAI API key validation: Working (requires sk- prefix)
- Error handling: User-friendly error messages implemented

### ✅ Tool Registration and Discovery  
- Status: PASSED
- Tools available: memory_store, memory_find
- Schema validation: Implemented for both tools
- Input validation: Comprehensive error handling

### ✅ Basic Operations
- Status: PASSED
- Memory store: Functional for basic content/kind format
- Memory find: Functional for semantic search
- Qdrant integration: Auto-creates collections when needed

## Knowledge Types Coverage Analysis

### Already Tested (9/16 types - from existing functional tests)
✅ Section - Documentation and knowledge organization
✅ Runbook - Procedure and workflow storage  
✅ Change - Modification tracking and history
✅ Issue - Problem documentation and resolution
✅ Decision - Choice tracking and rationale
✅ Todo - Task management and status
✅ Release_note - Version documentation
✅ DDL - Schema change tracking
✅ PR_context - Pull request metadata

### Missing Coverage (7/16 types - NEED TESTING)
❌ Entity - Component tracking and relationships
❌ Relation - Dependency and connection mapping
❌ Observation - Fact storage and retrieval
❌ Incident - Impact/timeline documentation
❌ Release - Deployment and version management
❌ Risk - Assessment and mitigation tracking
❌ Assumption - Validation and assumption tracking

## Critical Issues Identified

### Build System Issues
- Multiple TypeScript compilation errors
- Missing dependency declarations (@qdrant/client, pg modules)
- Configuration file conflicts (duplicate qdrant properties)
- Type mismatches in database configuration

### Test Infrastructure Issues
- Integration tests fail due to missing dependencies
- Unit tests have promise handling warnings
- Coverage thresholds not met for src/db/** and src/utils/**
- Many test files cannot load required modules

## Performance Testing Requirements
- Response time benchmarks not established
- Concurrent operation testing not performed
- Load testing with large datasets pending
- Memory usage profiling needed

## Security Testing Requirements  
- Input validation for injection attacks needed
- Query sanitization testing required
- API key security validation needed
- Error message information disclosure testing

## Next Priority Actions
1. Test missing 7 knowledge types using MCP tools directly
2. Validate OpenAI integration under various error conditions
3. Establish performance benchmarks
4. Execute security validation tests
5. Resolve build system issues for long-term test stability
