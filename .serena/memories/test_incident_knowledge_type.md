## Security Incident: Authentication Service Outage

### Incident Overview
**Incident ID:** INC-2025-042  
**Severity:** Critical (P0)  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Start Time:** 2025-10-25 10:15:00 UTC  
**End Time:** 2025-10-25 11:45:00 UTC  
**Duration:** 1 hour 30 minutes  
**Affected Services:** authentication-service, dependent applications

### Impact Assessment
**Business Impact:**
- Users unable to log in to all company applications
- 100% authentication failure rate
- Estimated 25,000 affected users
- Customer service call volume increased by 400%

**Technical Impact:**
- Complete authentication service outage
- Session cache invalidation
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- API gateway timeout cascades

### Timeline of Events

**10:15 UTC** - Monitoring alerts triggered
- Authentication service health checks failing
- Database connection timeout errors
- Error rate spiked to 100%

**10:20 UTC** - Incident response team engaged
- On-call engineer paged
- Slack incident channel created
- Initial assessment: database connectivity issue

**10:35 UTC** - Root cause investigation
- Database server CPU at 100%
- Long-running queries identified
- Connection pool exhausted (200/200 connections)

**10:50 UTC** - Mitigation actions
- Killed problematic long-running queries
- Increased connection pool size temporarily
- Implemented read-only mode for non-critical operations

**11:15 UTC** - Service restoration
- Authentication service responding to health checks
- User login functionality restored
- Monitoring showing normal operation

**11:45 UTC** - Incident resolution
- All services fully operational
- Performance metrics back to normal
- Incident documentation completed

### Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Cause:** Database table lock due to unoptimized batch job
- Background job: user_profile_cleanup
- Lock duration: 45 minutes
- Affected tables: user_profiles, user_sessions

**Contributing Factors:**
- Missing database index on cleanup query
- Insufficient connection pool monitoring
- Lack of job execution time limits

### Resolution Actions
**Immediate:**
- Terminated problematic database job
- Added missing database index
- Increased connection pool monitoring

**Short-term (Next 24 hours):**
- Implemented job execution time limits
- Added database performance alerts
- Updated connection pool configuration

**Long-term (Next 2 weeks):**
- Database query optimization review
- Implement read replicas for batch operations
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting

### Lessons Learned
- Need better database job scheduling during off-peak hours
- Require database performance reviews for all batch operations
- Improve connection pool monitoring and auto-scaling
- Implement database query execution time limits
