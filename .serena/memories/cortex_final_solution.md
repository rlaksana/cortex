# CORTEX MCP FINAL SOLUTION - 2025-10-21

## Database Reset Completed Successfully:
✅ PostgreSQL 18 running with correct credentials
✅ All 18 tables created with perfect naming consistency
✅ Migration: `20251021144601_initial_setup` applied
✅ Prisma schema properly aligned

## Current Issue:
Prisma client generated with `--no-engine` flag causing connection errors for direct testing

## User Request:
"ss much test as u can for 16 types n 9 log. use agents"

## Next Action Plan:
1. Regenerate Prisma client with full engine
2. Deploy 5 agents for comprehensive testing:
   - Agent 1: Test all 16 knowledge types CRUD
   - Agent 2: Test 9-log maintenance protocol
   - Agent 3: Test MCP server integration
   - Agent 4: Test performance and concurrency
   - Agent 5: Test security and validation

## Final Goal:
Complete system validation to confirm database reset solved all issues

## Status: Ready for comprehensive multi-agent testing
